2. Access to third-party apps: You can install apps and tweaks that are not available on the official App Store. These can provide additional functionality or customization options that are not allowed by Apple.

3. File system access: Jailbreaking grants you access to the iPhone's file system, allowing you to browse, edit, and manage files that are otherwise hidden from users. This can be useful for advanced users and developers.

4. Enhanced system controls: With a jailbroken iPhone, you can access and control various system settings and features that are typically restricted, such as tethering, network settings, and more.

5. Improved multitasking: Some jailbreak tweaks can enhance the multitasking capabilities of your iPhone, allowing you to have more control over app switching and background processes.

6. Ad-blocking: You can install ad-blockers and privacy-enhancing tools to reduce the number of ads and tracking on your device.

7. Bypassing restrictions: Jailbreaking can help you bypass carrier restrictions or limitations, such as unlocking your iPhone to use it with different carriers.
